// WHILE WE REPEAT

/*
The while statement always appears at the beginning or end of a loop.
The easiest type of loop that uses while is called the while loop. (The other is called the do...while loop.
You’ll see it a little later.)

Here is the format of while:

        while (condition)
        { block of one or more C statements; }

The condition is a relational test that is exactly like the relational test condition you learned for if.
The block of one or more C statements is called the body of the while.
