/* You won’t become an ace programmer if you aren’t exposed a bit to searching and sorting values. */


// FILLING ARRAYS

/*
Your programs can and will fill arrays using a combination of all three of these methods:

    • Assignment

    • User data entry

    • Disk files

NOTE:
Concentrate on what you do with arrays after the arrays get filled with values.
One of the most important things to do is find values that you put in the arrays.
