// ARRAYS OF POINTERS

/*
If you want to use a bunch of pointers, create an array of them. An array of pointers is just as easy to define as an array of any other
kind of data, except that you must include the * operator after the data type name.

The following statements reserve an array of 25 integer pointers and an array of 25 character pointers:

        int * ipara[25];   // 25 pointers to integers
        char * cpara[25];  // 25 pointers to characters

*/
